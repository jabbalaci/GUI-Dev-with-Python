Simple Examples
===============

These are simple examples using PyQt5.

Here everything is written manually, i.e.
we don't use Designer yet.

For these examples, I used Parwiz Forogh's PyQt5 tutorial
that you can find here: [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1FgJUcJJ03uwFW8ys2ov2dffKs3ieGYk).
